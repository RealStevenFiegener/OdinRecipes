    <h3>But how do we combine these ingredients to create something this beautiful?</h3>
    <h4>Just follow these Instructions:</h4>
    <h4>For the Chocolate Cake:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350Â°(F). Generously spray two 9-inch round baking pans with<br>
            non-stick baking spray and set them aside.</li>
        <li>In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment,<br>
            or in a large bowl using an electric mixer, combine both sugars, flour, cocoa, baking soda, baking powder and salt<br>
            on low until ingredients are thoroughly combined. Set aside.</li>
        <li>In a separate large mixing bowl, whisk together the eggs, yolk, sour cream, milk, oil and vanilla, beating until well combined.<br>
            Add the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and beat on low speed until just incorporated.<br>
            Carefully add in hot coffee (or water) and continue beating until completely combined; about 1 minute.<br>
            The batter will quite thin.</li>
        <li>Divide batter evenly into prepared pans.</li>
        <li>Bake in preheated oven for 30 to 35 minutes, or until wooden toothpick or cake tester inserted in the center<br>
            of a cake comes out clean or with just a few moist crumbs attached.</li>
        <li>Cool cakes for 10 minutes in the pan (placed on top of a cooling rack)<br>
            before removing from pans and transferring to a cooling rack to cool completely.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Cherry Filling:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine all of the ingredients in a saucepan over medium-high heat. Simmer, stirring almost constantly,<br>
            until the mixture starts to thicken, about 6 minutes.</li>
        <li>Reduce heat to low and cook for another 2 minutes before removing from the heat.<br>
            Transfer to a heatproof bowl and cool completely before using.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>For the Whipped Cream Topping:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large bowl using a handheld electric mixer, or in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment,<br>
            beat the cream on medium-low, slowly adding in the confectioners' sugar. Add in the vanilla.<br>
            Then increase to medium-high speed and whip until stiff peaks form.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>For the Chocolate Glaze:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Finely chop the chocolate and place it in a small heatproof bowl. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Warm the cream over medium heat until it comes to a boil.<br>
            Add in the espresso powder and whisk smooth.</li>
        <li>Pour the cream over the chopped chocolate and let it sit for 1 minute, then whisk smooth.<br>
            Whisk in the kirsch, if using. Cool for 5 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
</div>
<div>
    <h4>How do you assembly the careful parts to a masterpiece of a cake?</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Using a long, serrated knife, slice each cake in half horizontally, so that you have 4 even layers.</li>
        <li>Place one cake layer on a large plate or cake stand.<br>
            Spread 1/2 cup of the whipped cream on top of the cake, then top with 1/3 cup of the cherry filling.<br>
            Top with another cake layer, and repeat the layering process, ending with the last cake layer on top.</li>
        <li>Spread all remaining whipped cream frosting over the top and sides of the cake.</li>
        <li>Slowly pour the glaze over the cake, letting it drip down the sides. Then sprinkle with mini chocolate chips.</li>
        <li>Allow the cake to set in the fridge for 20 minutes before slicing. Then serve, or store, in the refrigerator, for up to 1 hour.</li>
        <li>Right before serving, line the edge of the cake with fresh cherries, and top with chocolate shavings.</li>
    </ol>
