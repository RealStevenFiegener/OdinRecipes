        <h2>How come that shredded oatmeal works?</h2>
        <p>One day I didn't want to use flour so I shredded oatmeal as a replacement.<br>
        To my surprise: it worked just fine. Of course it tastes different but these pancakes<br>
        do deserve to be named heaven-like.</p>
        <p>But enough with the chit-chat: let's cut to the chase!</p>

        <h3>How do we get the oatmeal shredded?</h3>
        No problem, I got you. You either use a common blender and blend until you have oatmeal flour.<br>
        If you are that fortunate use a Thermomix. You can blend or grind to your liking.

            <li>Add cinnamon, eggs and proteinpowder and mix everything together.</li>
            <li>Best case: let it rest in the fridge for 20-30 minutes, If you want extra fluffy pancakes -<br>
            then add a little bit of sparkling water. Trust me!</li>
            <li>Now put your stove on medium heat and put in the coconut-oil. When temperature is reached,<br>
                add 2-3 tablespoons and let it bake. After flipping put a lid on the pan. 2 minutes on each side should suffice.</li>
        </ol>
